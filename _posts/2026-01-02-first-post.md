# Hello, I’m Khyarum — welcome to my personal blog.

I’ll be using this space to share short notes and, primarily, writeups and walkthroughs of TryHackMe rooms, CTF challenges, and other security-related challenges.

My goal is to publish clear, reproducible writeups and step-by-step walkthroughs that focus on how challenges are approached and solved, not just the final answers.

## What to expect

- Writeups and walkthroughs for TryHackMe rooms, CTFs, and challenge solutions (spoilers where appropriate)
- Short tutorials and configuration tips useful for solving challenges
- Links to tools and references I regularly use
- Occasional notes and summaries of lessons learned

## Why I write

This blog helps me organize my ideas, document my learning, and share useful findings with others. I hope you find something helpful here.
